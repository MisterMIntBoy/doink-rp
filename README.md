This is a simple RIch Presence script for your FiveM server.
IT is designed to show player location down to a neighborhood, but no smaller, so that people cannot location cheat using Discord.
You will have to set up a Discord Developer Account, which is free, and create an App, and go from there.
If you have any questions about how to set that up, feel free to contact me on Discord (My Discord is in the `cl.lua`).
